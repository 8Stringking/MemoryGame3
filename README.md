# Clone Wars Memory Game 

Welcome to the Clone Wars Memory Game, which is a themed remake of the popular Simon memory game from the 80's. However this game is all based upon the clone troopers from the 501st regiment from the Star Wars prequel films, and most notably 'Attack of the Clones'. and 'Revenge of the Sith'. 

The Overall aim of this project is to have built a functional memory game that is enjoyable to play, utilising stunning imagery of the clone troopers and giving the whole game a very star wars feel compared to the original simon game, and one where star wars fans can have a laugh as well.
