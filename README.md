# Clone Wars Memory Game 

Welcome to the Clone Wars Memory Game, which is a themed remake of the popular Simon memory game from the 80's. However this game is all based upon the clone troopers from the 501st regiment from the Star Wars prequel films, and most notably 'Attack of the Clones'. and 'Revenge of the Sith' aswell as the animated series 'The Clone Wars'.

The Overall aim of this project is to have built a functional memory game that is enjoyable to play, utilising stunning imagery of the clone troopers and giving the whole game a very star wars feel compared to the original simon game, and one where star wars fans can have a laugh as well.

## 1.Purpose of The Game/ Value To User
  [Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

The purpose of this game is to provide star wars fans a fun memory game that is similar to the 80's game Simon, but with the type of escapism that is typical of star wars films. In the form of stunning imagery, and subtle references that star wars fans know all too well while testing their memory ability.

The value to the user is definately evoking a positive emotional response, while being functional in testing memory ability. This is done by blaster sounds in the game that is from the prequel trilogy, the introduction and instructions that have been written as if a commander of the clone troopers (501st, Captain Rex) was saying them himself. And the overall imagery of the game highlighting the clone troopers including some images not every fan has seen before, as currently I have found no such game in existance that provides these aspects.

## 2.Target Audience
[Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

The target audience for the game is set for two age groups. 

- 30 - 40 years old. This is because this is the age group that would have seen the prequel films as they were released as kids and will be able to relate to the subtle references in the game.

- 10 - 20 years old. Due to the popularity of Disney+ that now includes the back catalogue of star wars material, people of this age can conviently rewatch all the animated series along with the films and immerse themself in the story behind the clone troopers.

## 3.User Stories

1. - I am presented with an enter screen with instructions to the game.

2. - I am presented with a random sequence of panel clicks.

3. - When I input a sequence of panel clicks, I see this repeated with 1 more addition to the sequence.

4. - That I hear a sound for each panel and hear the correct sound when a button is clicked. And this sound is related to star wars.

5. - If I input the incorrect panel in the sequence, the game tells me so and repeats the pattern so I can try again

6. - I can clearly see how many clicks are in any given sequence

7. - I can play with accuracy mode engaged, which when a incorrect panel is clicked the game notifies me and restarts from the beginning of the game

Below is the original wireframes created for the game, and as you can see I was able to stick quite close to the original intended plans, and i was pleased to be able to keep it simple for the user to be able to easily navigate the site and the game itself, but also injecting the star wars feel that was so important for this game.
